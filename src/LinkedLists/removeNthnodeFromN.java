// Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head.

// Example:

// Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

// After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
// Note:

// Given n will always be valid.

// Follow up:

// Could you do this in one pass?

class removeNthFromEnd {
    public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
    
    ListNode start = new ListNode(0);
    ListNode slow = start, fast = start;
    slow.next = head;
    
    //Move fast in front so that the gap between slow and fast becomes n
    for(int i=1; i<=n+1; i++)   {
        fast = fast.next;
    }
    //Move fast to the end, maintaining the gap
    while(fast != null) {
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next;
    }
    //Skip the desired node
    slow.next = slow.next.next;
    return start.next;
}
}
// A one pass solution can be done using pointers. Move one pointer fast --> n+1 places forward, to maintain a gap of n between the two pointers and then move both at the same speed. Finally, when the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be n+1 places behind - just the right spot for it to be able to skip the next node.

// Since the question gives that n is valid, not too many checks have to be put in place. Otherwise, this would be necessary.
